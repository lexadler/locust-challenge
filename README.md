# locust-challenge

## Pre-requisites
1. Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Create and activate virtual environment in the project directory.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install Poetry.
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools  # Update Python package management tools
pip install poetry  # Install Poetry
```
4. Install project dependencies (excluding linting tools).
```bash
poetry install --without lint
```
5. (Optional) Compile protobuf files via script.  
**Autogenerated files are included, but if .proto files are updated, the script will automatically fix all imports to be relative after running grpc_tools.protoc, so no manual changes are needed.**
```bash
poetry run python tools/generate_pb.py
```

## Usage
Run Locust in standard UI mode:
```bash
locust
```
For more configuration options (like headless mode) and advanced usage, feel free to refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/).
